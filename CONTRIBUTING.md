# Contributing to Project BinaryBrains

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We welcome contributions from all team members.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes

1. Make sure you're on the latest version:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Create a new branch from `main`
3. Install dependencies in both frontend and backend directories

### Making Changes

1. Write clean, readable code
2. Follow the existing code style and structure
3. Test your changes locally
4. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

Examples:
- `Fix navigation bug in header component`
- `Add user authentication endpoint`
- `Update README with installation steps`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Push your changes** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to the main repository
3. **Fill out the PR template** with:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issue numbers
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
   - Testing steps
4. **Wait for review** from team members
5. **Address feedback** if any changes are requested
6. Once approved, your PR will be merged!

## Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing others' code:
- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain your reasoning
- Approve when the code meets standards

## Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests

Examples:
- `feature/user-login`
- `fix/navbar-responsive-issue`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`

## Code Style

### Frontend (React)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Backend (Node.js)
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Handle errors properly
- Validate input data

## Testing

- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting a PR
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Add new tests for new features when applicable

## Questions?

If you have any questions or need help, feel free to:
- Open an issue for discussion
- Reach out to team leads
- Ask in team communication channels
